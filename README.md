# MicroCalendar ðŸŽ¶

## Introduction ðŸ–‹

Honestly, this repo is mostly for me to play around with a working application that doesn't need yarn or npm to run.

It is based on MicroSymfony, a Symfony application skeleton.

Eventually I will port everything from https://github.com/tacman/calendar-bundle-demo, which DOES use webpack.

In the meantime, the only things this really does is show a problem using the awesome fullcalendar library as a module.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tacman/micro-calendar && cd micro-calendar && composer install && symfony server:start -d 
```

Note the lack of yarn install && yarn dev!
